# Discriminant Analysis

**DiscriminantAnalysis.jl** is a Julia package for multiple linear and quadratic 
regularized discriminant analysis (LDA & QDA respectively). LDA and QDA are
distribution-based classifiers with the underlying assumption that data follows
a multivariate normal distribution. LDA differs from QDA in the assumption about 
the class variability; LDA assumes that all classes share the same within-class 
covariance matrix whereas QDA relaxes that constraint and allows for distinct 
within-class covariance matrices. This results in LDA being a linear classifier
and QDA being a quadratic classifier.
